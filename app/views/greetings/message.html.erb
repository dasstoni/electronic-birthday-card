    Happy Birthday to the most wonderful mother anyone could ever ask for. I hope you have had a relaxing and enjoyable day because you deserve it!
    The more time that passes the more I grow to appreciate you and how much you impact my life and influence me to be a better human being. <b>You're AWESOME!!</b>
    I figured I'd use some of the things I've learned to give you an electronic birthday card.
